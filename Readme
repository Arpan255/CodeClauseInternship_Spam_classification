# Spam Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The project utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model for identifying spam emails.

## Project Overview

Spam emails can be a nuisance and a potential security risk. This project aims to develop an automated solution for classifying emails as spam or ham using machine learning. By training a model on a labeled dataset of emails, we can create an accurate classifier that can help filter out unwanted messages.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of labeled emails, with each email marked as spam or ham. The dataset is available at Kaggle. 
The data preprocessing and feature extraction steps are detailed in the Colab Notebook.
